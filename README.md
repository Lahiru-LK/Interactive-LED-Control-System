## Project Overview 🚀

This project includes an interactive LED control system using the following components:

- Arduino Mega 🤖
- Three 28BYJ-48 Stepper Motors ⚙️
- 100 WS2812B Individual Addressable LEDs 💡
- One IIC I2C 2004 LCD Module 20x04 LCD Screen 🖥️
- One KY-040 Rotary Encoder Module 🔄

## Stepper Motor Features 🎛️

- Constantly steps 🚶‍♂️
- 5 selectable speeds for each stepper via Menu (LCD Screen + Rotary Encoder) ⚡
- Two selectable rotation settings for each stepper CW\CCW via Menu (LCD Screen + Rotary Encoder) ↩️
- Selectable On\off feature for each stepper via Menu (LCD Screen + Rotary Encoder) 🔄

## LED Features 💡

- 5 selectable intensities for each LED group (Main Lights, Small Cone Lights, Medium Cone Lights, Large Cone Lights) via Menu (LCD Screen + Rotary Encoder) 🔆
- 5 selectable patterns for each LED group via Menu (LCD Screen + Rotary Encoder) 🌀
- Selectable On\off feature for each LED Group via Menu (LCD Screen + Rotary Encoder) 🚥

## System Navigation 🌐

- Displays 6 menu pages 📑
- Highlights menu items on the settings page via cursor 🔍

## Encoder Interaction 🎛️

- When the user presses the encoder button, they can rotate the encoder shaft to jog through menu item options 🔄
- The user selects a different option by pressing the encoder button ✅

Feel free to explore, customize, and contribute to this interactive LED control system! 🚀✨
